# Learning Node.js
Todd is going to learn Node.js with this project.

# File Structure

## 1. Examples

  ### fs-read-write-file
    - foo.txt
    - index.js
*foo.txt*  - This was just an example file used in the initial lesson to demonstrate the ability for you to read and write files to the browser using node.js.

*index.js* - This is the index file where the browser renders the code that shows some text. The terminal will also generate some text that shows files being written and read.

  ### hello-world
    - index.js

*index.js* - This is the original hello-world app! Contains nothing but the hell-world text! Obligatory first project.

  ###  http-fs-counter
    - counter.txt
    - index.js

*counter.txt* - this is the latest project that Todd is working on. The counter.txt file gets created from the index.js file with the write function that Ionica taught Todd. In theory. It still isn't quite working right now...

  ### http-hello-world
    - index.js

  *index.js* - This is the index file that contains a more complete version of the hello-world app.
